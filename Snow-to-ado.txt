Here is an architectural flow diagram illustrating the integration between ServiceNow, Azure DevOps, Terraform, and Azure Firewall for automating firewall rule updates. Let me know if you need modifications or a more detailed version based on your specific implementation. ￼

======

Yes, your plan to automate the process of updating Azure Firewall rules using a ServiceNow workflow and Azure DevOps (ADO) pipelines is achievable. Below is a high-level flow diagram and architectural description of the integration and flow.

### **Architectural Description**

1. **ServiceNow Form Submission**:
   - A user submits a form in ServiceNow to request adding or removing their IP address to/from a specific category in the Azure Firewall.
   - The form captures details such as:
     - User’s IP address
     - Category (e.g., "Allowed" or "Blocked")
     - Reason for the request

2. **Approval Process**:
   - The request goes through an approval workflow in ServiceNow.
   - Approvers review the request and either approve or reject it.
   - If approved, the workflow proceeds to the next step.

3. **Update ADO Code (Terraform Stack)**:
   - Once approved, the ServiceNow workflow triggers an integration with Azure DevOps.
   - The integration updates the Terraform configuration files (e.g., `main.tf` or `variables.tf`) in the ADO repository with the new IP address and category.
   - This can be done using:
     - **ServiceNow REST API** to call an ADO API or webhook.
     - **ADO REST API** to update the repository programmatically.

4. **Trigger ADO Pipeline**:
   - After updating the Terraform code, the ServiceNow workflow triggers an ADO pipeline.
   - The pipeline is configured to:
     - Fetch the latest code from the repository.
     - Run `terraform plan` to validate the changes.
     - Run `terraform apply` to update the Azure Firewall rules.

5. **Azure Firewall Update**:
   - The Terraform pipeline applies the changes to the Azure Firewall, adding or removing the user’s IP address to/from the specified category.

6. **Notification**:
   - Once the pipeline completes, a notification is sent back to ServiceNow or directly to the user (via email or ServiceNow ticket) to confirm the update.

### **Key Components**

1. **ServiceNow**:
   - Custom form for user requests.
   - Approval workflow.
   - Integration with Azure DevOps (via REST API or webhook).

2. **Azure DevOps (ADO)**:
   - Repository for Terraform code.
   - Pipeline for Terraform plan and apply.
   - REST API or webhook to trigger the pipeline.

3. **Azure Firewall**:
   - Managed by Terraform.
   - Rules updated dynamically based on user requests.

4. **Integration Layer**:
   - REST APIs or webhooks to connect ServiceNow and Azure DevOps.
   - ServiceNow MID Server or Azure Logic Apps for orchestration (optional).

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **ServiceNow Workflow**:
   - Design the form and approval workflow.
   - Configure the integration with Azure DevOps (e.g., using REST API or webhook).

2. **Azure DevOps Pipeline**:
   - Create a pipeline to handle Terraform plan and apply.
   - Ensure the pipeline can accept parameters (e.g., IP address, category).

3. **Terraform Code**:
   - Update the Terraform configuration to dynamically accept IP addresses and categories as variables.

4. **Testing**:
   - Test the end-to-end flow with a sample request.
   - Validate that the Azure Firewall rules are updated correctly.
