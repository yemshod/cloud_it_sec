Ivanti Application Control – 5Ws Overview

⸻

1. What is Ivanti Application Control?

Ivanti Application Control, part of the Ivanti Neurons suite, is a security tool designed to enforce least privilege and application whitelisting on Windows endpoints. It allows enterprises to:
	•	Restrict the execution of unauthorized applications.
	•	Elevate privileges for trusted applications without granting full admin rights.
	•	Manage application access dynamically based on user roles or device attributes.
	•	Audit software execution and enforce policy-based control (Allow/Deny).

Core Functionalities Include:
	•	Application whitelisting and blacklisting
	•	Privilege management (e.g., elevate rights for specific tools without giving admin rights)
	•	Integration with AD, Azure AD (Entra), and service management systems
	•	Policy deployment via agent and centralized configuration management
	•	Policy testing via Audit Mode prior to enforcement

2. Who are the Stakeholders?

Role	Responsibility
???? & ???? (Engineering Team)	Day-to-day configuration, management, and maintenance of Ivanti Application Control policies.
[Team Lead/Manager]	Oversees high-level status and strategic alignment of Ivanti deployment.
Users (Employees)	Subject to application execution restrictions and privilege policies.
IT Helpdesk / Service Desk	Provides support for blocked applications and assists with exception handling.
ITSM Integrations (e.g., ServiceNow)	Automatically logs tickets on policy violations or user requests.

3. Why is Ivanti Being Used?

Ivanti Application Control is adopted to secure endpoint environments through:
	•	Enforcing Least Privilege Access: Users operate with standard rights unless specific elevation is explicitly configured.
	•	Reducing Attack Surface: By blocking execution of unapproved or vulnerable applications (e.g., known malicious file extensions, .jar, .dll).
	•	Support for Compliance: Helps meet internal security policies, Zero Trust mandates, and external compliance requirements.
	•	Operational Flexibility: Allows seamless elevation for specific roles and applications without granting full local admin.
	•	Preventing Unauthorized Software: Ensures only vetted applications are executed, preventing shadow IT or lateral movement.

4. Where is Ivanti Deployed and Managed?

Location/Scope	Details
Ivanti Neurons Cloud Console (Tenant)	Centralized administration portal for policy management and integration.
Endpoint Agents (Windows PCs)	Ivanti agents installed locally execute the latest downloaded policy files.
Policy Configuration Files	Managed and versioned via the console; stored as flat files on endpoints.
Group & Privilege Definitions	Policies defined under “Group Management”, mapped to AD or Entra groups.
Audit Logs & Enforcement Outcomes	Logged locally and can be integrated with ITSM for alerting and ticketing.

5. When and How is it Used?

Stage	Action
Initial Setup	Agent installation, policy baseline configuration, and mapping of AD/Azure groups to policy sets.
Audit Mode	Policies run in non-enforcement mode to observe real-world usage and refine rules.
Policy Enforcement	Finalized policies deployed to endpoints for active control (e.g., allow, block, elevate).
Exception Handling	Users can request access; block notifications include support contacts.
Ongoing Management	Continuous refinement of group policies, monitoring logs, and adjusting privilege rules based on feedback.

Additional Capabilities:
	•	Policies support wildcard matching (e.g., *.dll, *.jar)
	•	Group-based control enables centralized handling of folder paths or file types
	•	Customized notifications on block (e.g., “Contact CSC for assistance”)
	•	ServiceNow or ITSM integration allows ticket generation from block events

⸻

Additional Notes
	•	Group Management is a powerful feature to avoid managing individual file paths across policies.
	•	Elevation Scenarios: Allows selective admin rights (e.g., allow Configuration Manager, deny Print Management).
	•	Recommended Block Lists: Can be imported (e.g., Microsoft’s default deny lists).
	•	Not a Vulnerability Scanner: Ivanti doesn’t assess file vulnerabilities; it enforces pre-defined allow/deny policies.

⸻

Next Steps and Recommendations
	•	Setup Access Groups in Entra ID for each application requiring control or elevation.
	•	Build Policies Iteratively: Start in audit mode, gather behavioral data, and then move to enforcement.
	•	Establish Group Naming Convention: Ensure groups used for installation/elevation are aligned and future-proof.
	•	Enable ITSM Integration: Finalize ServiceNow (or equivalent) integration for real-time alerts and ticket routing.
	•	Define a Governance Workflow: For exception requests, policy updates, and periodic audits
