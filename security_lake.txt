   - Utilize AWS cost management tools and strategies to optimize data storage and processing costs, ensuring the solution remains cost-effective.

By adopting AWS Security Lake, ExacTrust can significantly enhance its security capabilities, improve operational efficiency, and achieve better compliance and cost management, making it a strategic addition to the company's security infrastructure. However, it should be seen as a complement to existing tools rather than a replacement, ensuring that specialized capabilities provided by tools like Splunk, Snowflake, Prisma Cloud, AWS GuardDuty, and AWS Config are still leveraged effectively.
