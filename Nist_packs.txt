   - **Objective:** Identify gaps in current rules against policy directives and NIST assessments.
   - **Actions:**
     - Assess AWS services (e.g., S3, EC2, VPC, CloudTrail) for unaddressed risks.
     - Use AWS Config custom rules for any gaps.

#### **Phase 3: Custom Guardrails**
   - **Objective:** Build and implement custom detection, prevention, and response mechanisms.
   - **Actions:**
     - Create AWS Config custom rules to monitor IAM misconfigurations.
     - Define preventative SCPs for critical compliance violations.
     - Develop CloudWatch Alarms for responding to suspicious activities.

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **NIST 800-53 Conformance Pack** provides the highest control coverage but lacks AWS-specific service coverage.
2. **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices Conformance Pack** excels in AWS service coverage but has limited alignment with NIST 800-53 and CIS Benchmark.
3. **AWS CIS Benchmark Conformance Pack** offers a balance between AWS service coverage and alignment with industry standards but does not fully cover NIST 800-53.

By using these metrics and justifications, we can objectively measure the coverage differences between the packs and determine their suitability for specific use cases. Let me know if you need further clarification!
