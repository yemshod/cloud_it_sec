   - **Actions:**
     - Map all AWS services used to NIST 800-53 controls.
     - Leverage AWS Security Hub for integrating and monitoring conformance packs.
     - Prioritize domains: IAM > Data Protection > Monitoring.

#### **Phase 2: Gap Analysis**
   - **Objective:** Identify gaps in current rules against policy directives and NIST assessments.
   - **Actions:**
     - Assess AWS services (e.g., S3, EC2, VPC, CloudTrail) for unaddressed risks.
     - Use AWS Config custom rules for any gaps.

#### **Phase 3: Custom Guardrails**
   - **Objective:** Build and implement custom detection, prevention, and response mechanisms.
   - **Actions:**
     - Create AWS Config custom rules to monitor IAM misconfigurations.
     - Define preventative SCPs for critical compliance violations.
     - Develop CloudWatch Alarms for responding to suspicious activities.
