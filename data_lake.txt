Internal Documentation for ExactTrust: AWS Data Lake
Overview
Introduction
AWS Data Lake is a versatile, cost-efficient data repository solution that supports the storage of both structured and unstructured data at scale. It enables ExactTrust to store data in its native format, facilitating diverse analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence applications. This document outlines the architecture, benefits, and best practices for implementing AWS Data Lake at ExactTrust.

Detailed Aspects of AWS Data Lake
What is a Data Lake?
A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

Data lakes are crucial for handling large volumes of data from diverse sources. Unlike traditional databases, data lakes enable storage of raw data in its original form, thus allowing the flexibility to analyze the data immediately, later, or never, depending on business needs.

Why Build a Data Lake on Amazon S3?
Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% durability and scales to meet the needs of ExactTrust’s growing data repositories. Key advantages include:

Security by Design: Amazon S3 includes comprehensive security and compliance capabilities that meet even the most stringent regulatory requirements.
Scalability on Demand: Amazon S3 automatically scales to handle high request rates and large data volumes.
Durability: Data stored in Amazon S3 is automatically replicated across multiple systems and facilities.
Integration with Third-Party Services: Amazon S3 integrates with numerous AWS services and third-party applications, facilitating robust data processing and analytics workflows.
Extensive Data Management Features: Amazon S3 offers sophisticated lifecycle management policies to automate data transitions to lower-cost storage tiers.
AWS Data Lake Architecture
AWS Data Lake is not a single product but an architectural pattern. It utilizes a schema-on-read approach, enabling you to store data without defining a schema in advance. The architecture comprises several critical components:

Landing Zone: The landing zone ingests raw data from various internal and external sources without transformation. This zone acts as a staging area where data remains in its original format.

Curation Zone: In this zone, data undergoes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. Tools like AWS Glue are used to crawl and catalog data, adding metadata and structuring it for analysis.

Production Zone: The production zone contains processed data ready for use by business applications, analysts, and data scientists. This data is refined, enriched, and optimized for performance.

Key technologies and services involved in AWS Data Lake architecture include:

Amazon S3: Core storage layer for raw and processed data.
AWS Glue: ETL service to transform, prepare, and load data.
Amazon Athena: Query service to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using SQL.
Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL database service for storing metadata and managing data catalogs.
Amazon Kinesis: Real-time data streaming service.
Amazon Elasticsearch Service: Search and analytics engine for real-time data exploration.
Amazon CloudWatch: Monitoring service to collect and track metrics.
Best Practices for AWS Data Lake
Ingestion:

Original Data Retention: Store data in its raw format to enable diverse future analyses. Use separate S3 buckets for transformed data to maintain data integrity.
Lifecycle Policies: Implement S3 lifecycle policies to move infrequently accessed data to Amazon Glacier for cost savings.
Organization:

Partitioning: Organize data into partitions within S3 buckets. Use logical partitions based on data attributes like date, category, or source.
Metadata Management: Use AWS Glue and DynamoDB to manage metadata, enabling efficient data cataloging and retrieval.
Preparation:

Dynamic Data Handling: Use Amazon Redshift or Apache HBase for processing dynamic data.
Immutable Data Storage: Store immutable data in S3 and use tools like Athena for transformations and analysis.
Real-Time Data Streaming: Utilize Amazon Kinesis for real-time data ingestion and processing, with Apache Flink for processing and S3 for storage.
AWS Lake Formation
AWS Lake Formation simplifies the setup and management of data lakes. It automates many of the complex manual steps typically involved in creating a data lake, including:

Data Collection: Automatically collects and catalogs data from various sources.
Data Ingestion: Streamlines the process of moving data into Amazon S3.
Data Organization: Helps in organizing data into a consistent, well-structured format.
Data Cleaning: Provides tools for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
Security Management: Implements fine-grained access controls to secure data at rest and in transit.
Lake Formation integrates seamlessly with AWS services like AWS Glue, Amazon S3, and AWS IAM, providing a unified interface for managing data lake operations.

Potential Benefits for ExactTrust
Implementing an AWS Data Lake can bring significant advantages to ExactTrust:

Scalable Data Storage: Handle ever-growing volumes of data with ease, ensuring all data is retained and accessible for future use.
Enhanced Data Security: Leverage AWS’s robust security features to protect sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
