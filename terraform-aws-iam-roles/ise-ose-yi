### **Weekly Status Update – \[06/16 – 06/20]**

**Summary:**
This week included focused engineering time on Ivanti security policy design and test readiness, continued refinement of Normalyze PoC outputs, and team-based review of inactive GCP organization policies. On the endpoint side, Mac security hardening validations were finalized for the completed baseline, with next steps coordinated for production deployment. Juneteenth was observed as a U.S. federal holiday.

#### **Key Project Highlights**

**Ivanti Application Control (IS-2759 / IS-2760):**

* Reviewed audit-mode policy and planned transition to enforcement with group-based exceptions (e.g., PowerShell)
* Confirmed device readiness for live testing and coordinated exemption design with IAM
* Drafted Change Request to allow outbound traffic to required Ivanti domains
* Submitted ticket to IAM to create AD groups for policy role targeting

**Normalyze DLP PoC (IS-276 / IS-1085):**

* Continued active testing of DLP policies across Azure services
* Identified and logged several telemetry and detection gaps with vendor for action
* Observed classification misalignment in storage policies; documented escalation paths

**GCP Organization Policy Automation (IS-2575):**

* Completed team-wide review of all inactive policies in scope
* Marked policy states (legacy, test, deprecated) and noted opportunities for rule reuse or cleanup

**Mac Security Hardening (Endpoint Engineering):**

* Validated previously completed security controls across managed macOS fleet
* Finalized readiness for production handoff
* Scheduled working session with deployment lead (Larry) for next-phase push
