Weekly Status Update – [05/19 – 05/23]

Summary:
This week’s efforts were heavily focused on hands-on validation and issue resolution related to the Normalyze PoC in the Azure environment. Additional time was dedicated to advancing familiarity with Ivanti Application Control through documentation study, and continuing GCP engineering training. Vendor collaboration was ongoing to address CosmosDB scanning issues encountered during testing.

Key Project Highlights

Normalyze DLP PoC (IS-276 / IS-1085):
	•	Executed full round of Azure-based test scenarios per defined use cases (file transfer, tagging, exfiltration)
	•	Encountered functional gap with CosmosDB scanning; worked directly with vendor support to troubleshoot
	•	Identified telemetry/data access limitations and updated evaluation worksheet accordingly
	•	Testing continues into next week pending vendor fix for CosmosDB visibility

Ivanti Application Control (IS-2759 / IS-2760):
	•	Expanded understanding of Ivanti enforcement rules, audit settings, and policy deployment behavior
	•	Reviewed example control files and observed runtime behavior via provided documentation
	•	Documented sample scenarios for future local lab testing

GCP Engineering Training (Ongoing):
	•	Completed several modules focusing on IAM, policy enforcement, and VPC Service Controls
	•	Applied training context to refine perspective on multi-cloud security guardrails
