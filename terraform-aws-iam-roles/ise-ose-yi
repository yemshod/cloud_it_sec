Here is your **Jira-ready Weekly Status Report for 06/09 – 06/13**, integrating your meeting hours, collaborative engineering tasks, Normalyze PoC work, Ivanti validation efforts, Mac hardening, and continued GCP lab completion.

### **Weekly Status Update – \[06/09 – 06/13]**

**Summary:**
This week involved active collaboration with cross-functional teams to troubleshoot a CI/CD pipeline issue, continued coordination and validation for Normalyze CES assessment and PoC, and deepening endpoint security configuration efforts around Mac hardening and Ivanti deployment. GCP training from the prior week was reinforced with hands-on lab completions. Several tasks required extended engagement beyond standard working hours to ensure continuity of security posture assurance and platform integration success.
