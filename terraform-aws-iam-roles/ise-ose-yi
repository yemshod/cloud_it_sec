Weekly Status Update – [06/02 – 06/07]

Summary:
This week’s engagements focused on policy validation across Mac endpoints, progressing the Normalyze PoC with targeted CosmosDB scanning fixes, and responding to additional risk queries from Tokyo. Efforts also advanced the Ivanti endpoint control configuration, while a full-day GCP security training session helped reinforce platform-specific engineering depth.
