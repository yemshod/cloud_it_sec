Thanks for sharing both `dev-deleting-ips.ps1` and `qa-deleting-ips.ps1`. I've done a line-by-line comparison and here is a **precise, technical differential analysis**:

## 🧠 The Only Functional Difference (Root Cause)

> **`qa-deleting-ips.ps1` is missing the logic that compares existing IPs with the target list (`$IPArray`) and calculates `$deletedIPs`.**

This causes:

* No IP rules to be flagged for deletion.
* No webhook sent.
* Update block runs but with already-matching IPs → Azure responds 200 with no change.

Meanwhile, the `dev` version:

* Defines `$deletedIPs` (and likely `$addedIPs` as well).
* Triggers update logic conditionally and logs deltas.
* Thus reflects visible change in CosmosDB state and pipeline logs.

---

## ✅ Recommendation: Patch `qa-deleting-ips.ps1`

Inject this logic block **after extracting `$ipAddresses`**, e.g. after line 45:

```powershell
# Define what to delete and what to add
$deletedIPs = $ipAddresses | Where-Object { $IPArray -notcontains $_ }
$addedIPs = $IPArray | Where-Object { $ipAddresses -notcontains $_ }

Write-Host "Current IPs: $($ipAddresses -join ', ')"
Write-Host "Target IPs: $($IPArray -join ', ')"
Write-Host "IPs to delete: $($deletedIPs -join ', ')"
Write-Host "IPs to add: $($addedIPs -join ', ')"
```

Then wrap the update logic:

```powershell
if ($deletedIPs.Count -gt 0 -or $addedIPs.Count -gt 0) {
    # Proceed with Update-AzCosmosDBAccount block
} else {
    Write-Information "No update needed — CosmosDB IPs already match desired configuration."
}
```

---

## 🛡 Bonus Enhancements (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Webhook Logging Even When No Update Occurs**:
   Send a log that confirms current config matches expected — useful for audit trails.

2. **Centralize the `$IPArray` list**:
   Put into a repo file (JSON or YAML) or secret KV to decouple script logic from config.

3. **Add `-WhatIf` Mode Support**:
   Let users simulate the delta and see the output before applying it (for dry-run testing).

Would you like a fully consolidated `.ps1` version of `qa-deleting-ips.ps1` with:

* Fixes applied
* Logging improved
* Best practice structure?

I can drop that for you immediately.
