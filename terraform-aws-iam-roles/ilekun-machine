Here are the key considerations for configuring Avanti policies and testing the agent functionality:

1. Policy Creation:
- Create a dev policy with inventory scanner and edge intelligence
- Set LAN and WAN settings to 50
- Configure reboot experience settings

2. Agent Installation:
- Download both the executable and options files
- Perform a silent install with elevated permissions
- Install on a test machine initially

3. Testing Approach:
- Start in audit mode to understand how policies impact the system
- Monitor event logs and AppSense logs
- Test with local "Everyone" and "Administrator" groups initially
- Observe which applications get blocked (e.g., CMD, PowerShell)

4. Group Management:
- Plan to create role-based groups for granular access control
- Prepare to use the TCR process for adding new groups
- Consider different policies for different user roles

5. Future Considerations:
- Plan to add certificate for Azure group access
- Prepare for potential Mac agent deployment
- Be ready to adjust policies based on initial testing results

The goal is to gradually build and refine policies while understanding the agent's impact on your environment

Here are the steps to create agent installation files:

1. Access Avanti Neurons Console
- Log into the cloud console
- Navigate to agent deployment section

2. Create Agent Policy
- Go to "Policies" section
- Create a new policy (e.g., "dev policy")
- Select inventory scanner and edge intelligence
- Configure LAN/WAN settings to 50
- Save the policy

3. Generate Enrollment Key
- Go to "Enrollment Keys" section
- Create a new key
- Name the key (e.g., "dev enrollment")
- Set number of allowed agents (recommended 20)
- Set expiration date (suggest 1 year out)

4. Prepare Installation Files
- Select "Agent Deployment"
- Choose manual install
- Select Windows platform
- Choose silent install option
- Copy the provided command line script
- Download executable and options files
- Ensure both files are in same location

5. Optional Certificate Configuration
- Prepare certificate for Azure group access
- Will be added to installation script in future stages

Key Tip: The command line script and downloaded files are critical for silent installation across multiple machines.


For Mac agent deployment, here are the key next steps:

1. Immediate Actions:
- Contact Avanti directly to understand Mac agent capabilities
- Schedule a specific meeting with Avanti to discuss Mac OS agent functionality
- Confirm exact protection and monitoring features for Mac devices

2. Current Limitations:
- No native app control format for Mac currently
- Limited understanding of Mac agent's full capabilities
- Need to verify inventory and control mechanisms

3. Planned Approach:
- Get detailed documentation from Avanti about Mac agent
- Determine if Mac agent supports:
  * Inventory tracking
  * Device monitoring
  * Application control
- Develop a separate testing strategy for Mac deployment

4. Installation Preparation:
- Obtain Mac-specific installation files
- Prepare for potential silent installation process
- Plan to test agent functionality in controlled environment

5. Coordination Needed:
- Involve IT security team in Mac agent evaluation
- Align Mac agent deployment with existing security policies
- Consider potential differences from Windows agent configuration


The primary focus is gathering comprehensive information about Mac agent capabilities before full deployment.
