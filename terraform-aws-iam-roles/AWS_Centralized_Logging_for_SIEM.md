# AWS Centralized Logging Strategy for SIEM Integration

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our strategy for centralizing AWS logs and integrating them with our enterprise SIEM solution (Sentinel/Splunk). The approach ensures comprehensive visibility across our AWS environment while optimizing for both security value and cost efficiency. The current state has CloudTrail logs directed to our audit account (123456789) with CloudWatch logs for CloudTrail stored in a centralized S3 bucket in our master account. This document expands on this foundation to create a more comprehensive logging strategy.

## Current Architecture

* CloudTrail logs are sent to the audit account (123456789)
* CloudWatch logs for CloudTrail are directed to a centralized S3 bucket in the master account

## Target Architecture

![AWS Centralized Logging Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500?text=AWS+Centralized+Logging+Architecture)

The target architecture will:

1. Maintain the existing CloudTrail configuration
2. Implement a centralized logging account for aggregation
3. Use Kinesis Data Firehose for real-time log streaming to our SIEM
4. Leverage S3 for cost-effective long-term storage and batch processing
5. Implement automated lifecycle policies for log retention

## Critical AWS Logs for SIEM Integration

The following logs are considered **critical** and should be prioritized for SIEM integration:

| Log Source | Description | Security Value | Implementation Approach |
|------------|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **AWS CloudTrail** | Records API calls across AWS services | Critical for detecting unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and resource manipulation | Already configured; ensure all management events and relevant data events are captured |
| **Amazon VPC Flow Logs** | Network traffic metadata for VPC interfaces | Critical for network threat detection, lateral movement, and data exfiltration analysis | Configure flow logs for all VPCs with 1-minute intervals and send to centralized CloudWatch log group |

## Implementation Considerations

### Log Collection Strategy

1. **Regional Aggregation**: Deploy log aggregation infrastructure in each active AWS region
2. **Cross-Account Access**: Use IAM roles to allow the logging account to collect logs from all accounts
3. **Real-time vs. Batch**: Use real-time streaming for critical security logs and batch processing for high-volume logs
4. **Sampling Strategy**: Implement intelligent sampling for high-volume, lower-value logs

### Log Transformation and Enrichment

1. **Field Normalization**: Standardize field names across different log sources
2. **Context Enrichment**: Add account context, resource tags, and business context
3. **Sensitive Data Handling**: Implement masking for sensitive fields (PII, credentials)
4. **Log Structure**: Convert all logs to structured JSON format for consistent processing

### SIEM Integration

1. **Ingestion Method**: Use direct API integration for critical logs and S3 polling for batch logs
2. **Throttling Controls**: Implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent SIEM overload
3. **Failure Handling**: Create dead-letter queues for failed log delivery
4. **Cost Optimization**: Implement intelligent filtering before SIEM ingestion

### Retention and Compliance

1. **Tiered Storage**: Implement S3 lifecycle policies (Standard → IA → Glacier)
2. **Retention Periods**:
   * Security investigation logs: 90 days in SIEM
   * Compliance logs: 1 year in warm storage
   * Archive logs: 7 years in cold storage
3. **Encryption**: Enforce encryption at rest using KMS with annual key rotation
4. **Access Controls**: Implement least-privilege access to log storage

## Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Planning & Design** | Weeks 1-2 | Finalize architecture, sizing, and cost estimates |
| **Foundation** | Weeks 3-4 | Set up logging account, IAM roles, and S3 infrastructure |
| **Critical Logs** | Weeks 5-8 | Implement collection for all critical log sources |
| **Important Logs** | Weeks 9-12 | Implement collection for important log sources |
| **SIEM Integration** | Weeks 13-16 | Develop and test SIEM connectors and dashboards |
| **Optimization** | Weeks 17-20 | Fine-tune collection, filtering, and alerting |
| **Nice-to-Have Logs** | Ongoing | Incrementally add additional log sources |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Log Filtering**: Filter out low-value log entries before storage
2. **Log Compression**: Enable compression for all logs stored in S3
3. **Intelligent Sampling**: Apply sampling for high-volume, low-value logs
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Automatically transition logs to lower-cost storage tiers
5. **SIEM Optimization**: Only forward security-relevant logs to the SIEM

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Log Delivery Monitoring**: Implement alerts for log delivery failures
2. **Volume Anomalies**: Monitor for unexpected changes in log volumes
3. **Coverage Gaps**: Regularly audit for new resources without logging enabled
4. **Performance Impact**: Monitor for any performance impact on source systems

## Conclusion

This centralized logging strategy provides comprehensive visibility across our AWS environment while balancing security value with cost efficiency. By prioritizing critical security logs for real-time SIEM integration and implementing a tiered approach for other logs, we can achieve both effective threat detection and compliance requirements.

The implementation will require cross-team collaboration between Security, Cloud Infrastructure, and Application teams to ensure proper configuration and minimal operational impact.
