Guardrail Tooling Assessment for Exact Trust’s Cloud Environments

Overview

Here’s a refined response incorporating your boss’s feedback:

Update on Guardrail Tooling Assessment:
	•	Prisma Cloud & AWS Config Capabilities Assessment - Completed
	•	Findings:
	•	Prisma Cloud offers robust multi-cloud guardrail enforcement with real-time risk detection and automated remediation workflows, making it ideal for preventive security.
	•	AWS Config is effective for configuration drift detection and compliance enforcement within AWS but requires additional automation (SSM, Lambda) for remediation.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Define specific guardrail policies for Prisma Cloud to align with Exact Trust’s security objectives.
	•	Optimize AWS Config custom rules to improve enforcement efficiency.
	•	Identify gaps where AWS Config and Prisma Cloud overlap or need complementary controls.
	•	AWS Security Hub - Assessment In Progress
	•	Focus Areas:
	•	Evaluating its role in centralizing security findings from AWS-native tools.
	•	Determining how it complements AWS Config and Prisma Cloud in compliance tracking and risk visibility.
	•	Assessing its effectiveness in real-time compliance monitoring.
	•	Next Steps Post Assessment:
	•	Recommend the best combination of these tools for automating guardrail enforcement and enhancing proactive risk management.
	•	Develop an implementation roadmap for integrating Prisma Cloud, AWS Config, and Security Hub into Exact Trust’s security governance model.
	•	Propose any necessary custom automation or remediation enhancements to strengthen enforcement.


This assessment evaluates the capabilities and limitations of AWS Config, AWS Security Hub, and Prisma Cloud in enforcing security guardrails across Exact Trust’s cloud environments. The primary objective is to determine the most effective combination of these tools for automating guardrail enforcement, enabling real-time compliance monitoring, and enhancing proactive risk management.

Below is a detailed comparison of these tools in terms of enforcement capabilities, compliance monitoring, and risk management effectiveness.

Comparison of Guardrail Tooling Capabilities

Feature	AWS Config	AWS Security Hub	Prisma Cloud
Primary Function	Configuration compliance & drift detection	Security findings aggregation & compliance monitoring	Cloud security posture management & workload protection
Guardrail Enforcement	Limited enforcement through remediation actions (SSM, Lambda)	No direct enforcement, only visibility and insights	Strong enforcement via policy controls, auto-remediation
Compliance Monitoring	Rule-based compliance checks	CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS, AWS Foundational Security Best Practices frameworks	Broad compliance coverage, including multi-cloud policies
Real-time Alerts	Near real-time, depends on periodic evaluations	Near real-time aggregation from AWS services	Real-time policy enforcement with immediate alerts
Customization	Custom AWS Config rules via Lambda	Custom insights via custom security standards	Highly customizable policies & custom risk detection
Remediation Actions	Remediation via SSM or Lambda automation	No remediation, only alerts	Automated remediation workflows
Integration with AWS Services	Native AWS service	Aggregates findings from AWS security tools	API-based integrations with AWS, Azure, GCP
Multi-Cloud Support	AWS only	AWS only	AWS, Azure, GCP
Cost Considerations	Pay per rule evaluation	Pay per finding ingestion	Licensing model varies based on workload coverage

Recommendations Summary

For Exact Trust’s cloud environments, the most effective approach involves a combination of AWS Config, AWS Security Hub, and Prisma Cloud to achieve comprehensive security guardrail enforcement.
	•	AWS Config should be leveraged for configuration compliance enforcement and drift detection, ensuring that resource configurations adhere to organizational policies.
	•	AWS Security Hub provides centralized security visibility, aggregating findings from multiple AWS security tools (e.g., GuardDuty, IAM Access Analyzer) to ensure compliance with industry frameworks.
	•	Prisma Cloud is best suited for multi-cloud guardrail enforcement, enabling real-time risk detection, proactive policy enforcement, and automated remediation workflows, making it a stronger candidate for preventive security.

Final Approach:
	•	Use AWS Config for automating resource compliance in AWS environments.
	•	Use AWS Security Hub for security posture visibility and compliance tracking.
	•	Use Prisma Cloud for multi-cloud enforcement, real-time threat mitigation, and advanced policy enforcement.

This combination will ensure proactive risk management, continuous compliance, and automated security governance across Exact Trust’s cloud environments.
