Rules Triggered by
Preventive:

Configuration check using tools like AWS Config Rules to enforce policies such as restricted instance types, required tags, and VPC endpoint usage.
Responsive:

Automated responses or notifications for unauthorized changes, such as deletion of directory services or unauthorized administrative access, through AWS Lambda and SNS.
Detective:

Continuous monitoring using AWS Config, GuardDuty, and CloudTrail to detect unusual access patterns, unauthorized changes, or configuration drift in AWS Managed AD.

=============================

Enhanced Security Guardrails for AWS Managed AD
1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for AD Users
Requirement: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all AWS Managed AD users who have administrative privileges or access sensitive data. While AWS Managed AD itself doesn’t directly support MFA, integrate it with AWS SSO or an identity provider (IdP) that can enforce MFA.
Justification: This adds an additional layer of security, reducing the risk of credential theft or unauthorized access.
2. Conditional Access Policies
Requirement: Implement conditional access policies to restrict login to AWS Managed AD based on factors such as device compliance, IP address, geolocation, or time of day.
Justification: Limiting access based on contextual information mitigates the risk of unauthorized access from unexpected locations or devices.
3. Session Timeout and Inactivity Policies
Requirement: Configure session timeout and automatic logout policies to minimize the risk associated with unattended active sessions.
Justification: Enforcing session timeouts reduces the attack surface by automatically logging out users after periods of inactivity.
4. Regular Password Hashing Algorithm Update
Requirement: Ensure that password hashing algorithms used in AWS Managed AD comply with industry standards (e.g., bcrypt or SHA-256). AWS Managed AD should be configured to disable legacy protocols and outdated hash algorithms where possible.
Justification: Updating hashing algorithms ensures that stored credentials are protected against brute-force and rainbow table attacks.
5. Automated Security Baseline Compliance Audits
Requirement: Use AWS Config or third-party tools like Tenable or Qualys to regularly audit AWS Managed AD against security baselines (e.g., CIS benchmarks or custom corporate standards).
Justification: Ensures continuous compliance with security standards, helping to identify and mitigate misconfigurations in real-time.
6. Restrict AD Management Console Access
Requirement: Restrict access to the AD Management Console through specific IP addresses or VPN only.
Justification: This provides an additional layer of security by ensuring that only users within the corporate network can access sensitive management interfaces.
7. Enhanced Auditing and Logging for Sensitive AD Operations
Requirement: Enable detailed logging for sensitive operations (e.g., changes in group memberships, privilege escalations, and policy modifications). Use CloudWatch and CloudTrail to store and analyze logs, potentially integrating with a SIEM solution like Splunk.
Justification: Detailed logging allows for comprehensive forensic analysis in the event of a security incident, ensuring that all key actions within AWS Managed AD are auditable.
8. Privileged Access Management (PAM) Integration
Requirement: Integrate AWS Managed AD with a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution to control and monitor access to privileged AD accounts.
Justification: PAM solutions can enforce Just-In-Time (JIT) access, further securing privileged accounts by reducing their exposure and ensuring temporary access for administrative tasks only.
9. Automated Remediation for Misconfigurations
Requirement: Configure AWS Lambda functions or use AWS Systems Manager Automation to automatically remediate certain misconfigurations in AWS Managed AD, such as unauthorized changes to security policies or settings.
Justification: Automated remediation reduces the risk of prolonged exposure due to misconfigurations, helping to maintain a secure environment continuously.
10. Cross-Region Replication for Disaster Recovery
Requirement: Enable cross-region replication and failover for AWS Managed AD to support disaster recovery in multi-region setups.
Justification: Ensures directory availability even in the event of a regional outage, enhancing business continuity and resilience.
Preventive Guardrails
Policy Templates for Consistency

Use standardized policy templates to ensure consistency across AWS Managed AD instances. AWS Config Rules or IAM policy templates can enforce consistent settings and restrictions.
Regular Policy Review and Clean-Up

Implement periodic review and clean-up of IAM policies associated with AWS Managed AD, focusing on removing unnecessary privileges and adhering to the least privilege principle.
Limit Number of AD Instances

Limit the number of AWS Managed AD instances per account to only what is necessary, reducing administrative complexity and potential misconfigurations.
Responsive Guardrails
Alert on Privilege Escalations

Set up alerts in CloudWatch for any privilege escalation activities, such as new additions to highly privileged groups like “Domain Admins” or “Enterprise Admins.”
Real-Time Threat Intelligence Integration

Integrate with AWS GuardDuty or other threat intelligence solutions to receive alerts on suspicious activities (e.g., unusual login attempts, large numbers of failed logins) associated with AWS Managed AD.
Detective Guardrails
Audit Access Logs Regularly

Set up a schedule to audit AWS Managed AD access logs and look for patterns such as unusual login locations, login times, or unexpected failed login attempts.
Role-Based Anomaly Detection

Utilize machine learning models or pattern analysis to detect anomalous behavior within roles associated with AWS Managed AD. For instance, monitoring unusual frequency of logins or changes can highlight potential compromised accounts or malicious activity.
Compliance & Documentation
Regular Security Awareness Training for AD Administrators

Mandate security awareness training for AWS Managed AD administrators, specifically covering best practices and policies for managing directory services.
Document Configuration Changes

Maintain detailed documentation on all configuration changes to AWS Managed AD, including justification, approval records, and rollback plans. This documentation should be readily available for audit purposes.
Configuration Drift Detection

Use AWS Config or a similar service to detect configuration drift in AWS Managed AD instances and automatically notify administrators if any non-compliant changes are identified.
