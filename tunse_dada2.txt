Yes — your setup with separate build and deploy workflows per account, and the desire to run only the relevant pipeline per account based on the PR, can be fully supported using the branch naming convention combined with GitHub matrix filtering.

Let me tailor the answer specifically for your scenario:

⸻

Your Setup Recap
	•	You have multiple AWS accounts (account1, account2, etc.)
	•	Each account has its own build and deploy workflow files, e.g.:

.github/workflows/
├── build-account1.yml
├── deploy-account1.yml
├── build-account2.yml
├── deploy-account2.yml

	•	Inside each account directory, there are departmental subfolders like:

automation/
compliance/
cspm/
monitoring/
scripts/


	•	You want:
	•	Only the build for the right account to run
	•	And inside that workflow, only the matching department job to execute

⸻

✅ Your Production-Ready Strategy

1. Branch Naming Convention per Account

Use branches like:

account1/automation/feature-add-roles
account2/compliance/bugfix-remediation

This encodes both the account and department into the branch name.

⸻

2. Configure build-account1.yml like this:

name: Build - Account1

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    strategy:
      matrix:
        department: [automation, compliance, cspm, monitoring, scripts]

    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ${{ matrix.department }}/pri-aws-accounts/primerica-dev-<ACCOUNT1-ID>/

    if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'account1/')

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Skip if department doesn't match
        if: startsWith(github.head_ref, format('account1/{0}/', matrix.department))
        run: echo "Proceeding with ${{ matrix.department }} deployment"

      # Terraform init, plan steps...

This means:
	•	Only build-account1.yml runs for PRs from account1/...
	•	Within that, only the matrix job matching the department in the branch runs
	•	All other departments will skip

⸻

3. Your build-account2.yml would look similar, just using:

if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'account2/')



⸻

4. Your Paths Can Be Kept Static per Workflow

Each workflow can keep its department path filters scoped, like:

paths:
  - automation/pri-aws-accounts/primerica-dev-<account1-id>/**
  - compliance/pri-aws-accounts/primerica-dev-<account1-id>/**
  ...

This is optional if you fully rely on head_ref.

⸻

✅ What You Achieve

Feature	Achieved?
Only one workflow runs per PR	Yes — via startsWith(github.head_ref, 'account1/')
Only one matrix job runs per PR	Yes — via startsWith(github.head_ref, format('account1/{0}/', matrix.department))
Easy to scale to N accounts	Yes — just duplicate the workflow and update branch prefix + backend
GitHub compute cost minimized	Yes — no redundant jobs



⸻

Final Notes
	•	This model assumes you enforce branch naming policies (via pre-commit hooks or docs).
	•	You can optionally use workflow_dispatch to override manual selections.
	•	Add a PR label or metadata check if you want to override with approval gates (/ok-to-apply logic).

⸻

Would you like me to output a full working build-account1.yml using this model now — with all structure, filtering, and example Terraform sections baked in?


Perfect — now we’re aligning directory structure and branch naming conventions.

Let’s go through how to name the branch correctly for your scenario, and why.

⸻

Your File Path:

automation/pri-aws-accounts/primerica-dev-<account1-id>/developer-roles/main.tf

This indicates:
	•	You are working on:
	•	account1
	•	Under the automation department
	•	Inside the developer-roles resource scope

⸻

✅ Recommended Feature Branch Naming Convention

To match the production-ready GitHub Actions strategy I recommended, name the branch like:

account1/automation/feature/developer-roles

Or if you want to track work type clearly:

account1/automation/feature/add-developer-role-policy
account1/automation/bugfix/fix-tag-policy

The structure is:

account_id / department / work_type / short-description



⸻

Why This Works
	•	The workflow file is named per account (build-account1.yml)
	•	Inside the workflow, this check controls execution:

if: startsWith(github.head_ref, 'account1/')


	•	The matrix jobs represent each department:

matrix:
  department: [automation, compliance, cspm, monitoring, scripts]


	•	The department match logic:

if: startsWith(github.head_ref, format('account1/{0}/', matrix.department))



So only:
	•	build-account1.yml triggers
	•	And inside that, only the matrix job for automation runs

⸻

✅ Summary

Element	Value
File being changed	automation/pri-aws-accounts/primerica-dev-<account1-id>/developer-roles/main.tf
Git feature branch	account1/automation/feature/developer-roles
Workflow triggered	.github/workflows/build-account1.yml
Job that runs	build (automation) from matrix logic

gggggggggggggg

Excellent — here’s a full production-grade build-account1.yml, designed to support:
	•	PRs coming from branches like account1/automation/feature/xyz
	•	Multiple departments under account1 (automation, compliance, cspm, monitoring, scripts)
	•	Matrix strategy with branch-aware filtering (only matching department builds)
	•	Centralized Vault secrets for short-lived AWS credentials
	•	Modular working directory structure
