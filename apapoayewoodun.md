None
No
CrowdStrike and Tripwire can detect DLL hijacking; consolidation simplifies detection rules.
Step 4: Analysis of Findings
	•	Covered Areas: The tools (e.g., Palo Alto Networks, GuardDuty, Ping, CrowdStrike) address the Network Devices platform, Identity Provider/Office Suite platforms, and technique consolidation due to their broad network security, identity management, and endpoint detection capabilities.
	•	Gaps Identified: The primary gap is the lack of specific support for the ESXi platform. The 19 new sub-techniques may also pose a partial gap if the tools’ detection rules and signatures are not updated to reflect these additions.
	•	Process-Related: Improved mitigation descriptions rely on manual processes to update defensive strategies, which the tools can support but not automate fully.
Step 5: Recommendations
	•	ESXi Platform Gap: Implement VMware Carbon Black or vSphere Security to monitor and protect ESXi hypervisor environments, as no current tools target this platform.
	•	New Sub-techniques: Ensure Splunk, CrowdStrike, and other detection tools are updated with the latest MITRE ATT&CK v17 sub-technique definitions and detection rules to maintain coverage.
	•	Ongoing Alignment: Regularly review MITRE ATT&CK updates (e.g., v17.1 or future releases) and align tool configurations with new mitigation guidance and platform changes.
Summary
	•	The 2024 (v15, v16) and 2025 (v17) MITRE ATT&CK updates introduced the ESXi platform, Network Devices renaming, Identity Provider/Office Suite platforms, 19 new sub-techniques, improved mitigations, and technique consolidation.
	•	The existing Goldfield and SaaS tools cover most updates except for the ESXi platform, which requires a specialized solution.
	•	The table above highlights these mappings and gaps, with recommendations to address deficiencies.
If you have additional details from the images or need further granularity (e.g., specific sub-technique mappings), please let me know, and I can refine the analysis!

Thank you for the request to assess the OWASP Top 10 updates from last year (2024) to this year (2025) and map any new additions or differences against the tools provided in the images. Based on the available information and web context, I’ll analyze the updates, identify new additions or differences, and create a tailored table in GitHub Markdown format to map these against the tools from the Goldfield and SaaS domains, highlighting capability gaps and providing recommendations.
Step 1: Analysis of OWASP Top 10 Updates
Since the OWASP Top 10 for 2025 is still in the planning and data collection phase (with a release expected in the first half of 2025), definitive updates for 2025 are not yet available. However, I’ll use the latest available data and trends from 2021, 2023, 2024, and early 2025 predictions to infer potential updates or differences between 2024 and 2025. The analysis will focus on:
	•	2021 Baseline (Last Major Release): The OWASP Top 10 2021 included 10 categories, with three new categories (A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures, A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures, A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery), four with naming/scoping changes, and some consolidation. This serves as the foundation for subsequent updates.
	•	2023/2024 Context: The 2023 release candidate (often referenced as part of the 2024 cycle) introduced five new risks (e.g., Lack of Protection from Automated Threats, Unsafe Consumption of APIs, Broken Object Property Level Authorization), with some 2021 categories renamed or refined. The 2024 data collection (Jun-Dec 2024) and analysis (early 2025) suggest an evolution based on new threat data.
	•	2025 Predictions: Based on web sources and early 2025 discussions, the 2025 update is expected to refine existing categories, incorporate data from over 500k applications, and potentially add new risks identified through the 2024 survey (e.g., Race Conditions/Timing Attacks, Web Cache Poisoning) and CVE trends.
	•	Key New Additions/Differences (Inferred for 2025):
	1	Refined Automated Threats (e.g., Lack of Protection from Automated Threats): Enhanced focus on bot mitigation and DDoS protection, building on 2023’s introduction.
	2	Unsafe API Consumption: Expanded emphasis on API security risks, reflecting increased API usage.
	3	Broken Object Property Level Authorization: New focus on granular access control at the object level, introduced in 2023.
	4	Potential New Categories (e.g., Race Conditions/Timing Attacks): Predicted based on 2024-2025 CVE trends and industry surveys.
	5	Enhanced Logging and Monitoring: Further expansion of A09:2021 to include advanced incident detection, aligning with evolving breach detection needs.
These inferred updates reflect emerging threats and data-driven refinements, pending the official 2025 release.

| **Unsafe API Consumption**                    | Increased risks from poorly managed or unauthenticated API usage, leading to data leakage.    | Apigee, Imperva                                | None                           | Partial       | Apigee supports API management and security; Imperva adds WAF protection, but coverage may be incomplete without SaaS equivalents. **Recommendation**: Extend API security monitoring with a SaaS tool like Apigee Cloud. |
| **Broken Object Property Level Authorization**| New vulnerability focusing on granular access control at the object property level.          | CyberArk, AWS IAM, Active Directory, ADFS, Ping, SailPoint | CyberArk, AWS IAM, ADFS, Ping | No            | Tools support role-based and granular access controls for object-level authorization.  |
| **Potential New Category: Race Conditions/Timing Attacks** | Predicted addition based on CVE trends, involving concurrency issues in web apps.      | CrowdStrike, Tripwire                          | None                           | Yes           | No tools specifically detect or mitigate race conditions/timing attacks. **Recommendation**: Use tools like OWASP ZAP or custom scripts for detection. |
| **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring**           | Expanded focus on advanced incident detection and response through improved logging.         | Splunk, Proofpoint                             | None                           | Partial       | Splunk provides advanced logging and monitoring; Proofpoint aids email security logging, but broader coverage may be needed. **Recommendation**: Integrate a SIEM solution like Splunk Cloud for SaaS. |
Step 4: Analysis of Findings
	•	Covered Areas: Tools like Prolexic Akamai, Palo Alto Networks, and GuardDuty address refined automated threats. CyberArk, AWS IAM, and related tools cover broken object property level authorization. Apigee and Imperva partially address unsafe API consumption, while Splunk and Proofpoint support enhanced logging and monitoring.
	•	Gaps Identified: The primary gap is the lack of specific support for race conditions/timing attacks. Partial gaps exist for unsafe API consumption (limited SaaS coverage) and enhanced logging (broader SIEM integration needed).
	•	Process-Related: Implementation of new categories may require manual updates to policies and testing procedures, supported by existing tools but not fully automated.
Step 5: Recommendations
	•	Race Conditions/Timing Attacks Gap: Implement OWASP ZAP or develop custom detection scripts to identify and mitigate race conditions, as no current tools target this emerging threat.
	•	Unsafe API Consumption: Extend API security with a SaaS tool like Apigee Cloud to ensure comprehensive coverage across environments.
	•	Enhanced Logging and Monitoring: Integrate a cloud-based SIEM solution (e.g., Splunk Cloud) to enhance logging capabilities across Goldfield and SaaS domains.
	•	Ongoing Alignment: Monitor the official OWASP Top 10 2025 release (expected first half of 2025) and adjust tool configurations based on final categories and data.
Summary
	•	The inferred 2024-2025 OWASP Top 10 updates include refined automated threats, unsafe API consumption, broken object property level authorization, potential new categories like race conditions/timing attacks, and enhanced logging and monitoring.
	•	The existing Goldfield and SaaS tools cover most updates except for race conditions/timing attacks, with partial gaps in API security and logging.
	•	The table above highlights these mappings and gaps, with recommendations to address deficiencies.
