Thank you for providing the remaining four images! Since I cannot directly view or analyze images, I’ll rely on your earlier descriptions of the tools and domains, combined with any new details you might provide about these additional images. Based on your previous input, I’ll assume these images contain the complete list of tools and their respective domains, and I’ll proceed with regenerating the table for the NIST 800-53B Moderate controls mapping.
Assumptions and Approach:
	1	Tools List: From your earlier messages, you provided the following tools for Goldfield:
	◦	CyberArk, Keychain, RBD, Workday, MSOR, OIM, ED, Splunk, AWS Direct Connect, AWS Native/KMS, Vormetric Agent, Prolexic Akamai, Palo Alto Networks, GuardDuty, Ping, AWS IAM, AWS Simple AD, SOAR+, EnCase, TLS, HSM Clients, Symantec, McAfee.
	◦	SaaS: No additional tools were explicitly listed under SaaS previously.
	2	Since the four new images likely expand or refine this list, I’ll assume they either confirm the above tools or add new ones. If there are new tools or domains in these images, please let me know, and I’ll incorporate them. For now, I’ll proceed with the previously provided tools, as FAM was already identified as not being part of the explicit list (and was removed in the prior response).
	3	Strict Adherence: I’ll map the NIST 800-53B Moderate controls (161 rows, as previously established) using only the tools listed above. If a control has no matching tool, I’ll mark it as “No Capabilities” with a recommendation. If it’s process-related, I’ll mark it as “Process Related” with an explanation.
	4	Purpose: The goal is to identify capability gaps based on the controls’ requirements and address them with recommendations, ensuring compliance with the NIST 800-53B Moderate baseline.
	5	Questions: I don’t have any immediate questions, as I’ll proceed with the existing tools list. However, if the new images introduce additional tools or domains that differ significantly from the prior list, please provide those details, and I can adjust accordingly.
Regenerated Table: NIST 800-53B Moderate Controls Mapping
