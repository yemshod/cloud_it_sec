Would you like me to provide actionable recommendations for the “Not Covered” and “Partially Covered” items next? ￼


Here are tailored recommendations for the OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 categories currently Not Covered or Partially Covered, mapped to your environment:

⸻

LLM01: Prompt Injection – Partially Covered

Current Tools: ThreatModeler, Zscaler, GuardDuty
Gap: No runtime LLM-specific input validation or context-based prompt sanitization

Recommendations:
	•	Implement prompt validation middleware: Use open-source LLM security libraries (e.g., PromptGuard, Microsoft’s LLMGuard) within application layers to detect prompt manipulation attempts.
	•	Enhance threat modeling: Expand ThreatModeler to include misuse cases specific to LLM input vectors and downstream actions.
	•	Add runtime input monitoring: Use tools like LangChain or Rebuff to enforce safety rules dynamically before invoking model inference.

⸻

LLM03: Training Data Poisoning – Not Covered

Current Tools: None
Gap: No visibility into training data integrity or provenance

Recommendations:
	•	Introduce data lineage validation: Leverage solutions like DataHub or Amundsen to trace and validate sources of training sets.
	•	Establish secure MLOps pipelines: Integrate data validation gates in your CI/CD model training workflows.
	•	Conduct offline data sanitization scans: Tools like Snorkel or Amazon Macie (if integrated into model-building) can scan for toxic, biased, or malicious content.

⸻

LLM04: Model Denial of Service – Partially Covered

Current Tools: CrowdStrike, GuardDuty, Prolexic
Gap: No application-level LLM token abuse or rate-limiting protections

Recommendations:
	•	Rate-limit LLM API calls per user/session using API gateways (e.g., Apigee or AWS API Gateway).
	•	Introduce circuit breaker logic: Define max token budgets and abort logic at application layer if inference cost exceeds defined limits.
	•	Integrate LLM-aware WAF signatures: Add LLM-specific abuse patterns to Imperva or Zscaler for request inspection.

⸻

LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design – Not Covered

Current Tools: None
Gap: No review or isolation mechanism for third-party plugin code

Recommendations:
	•	Use software composition analysis (SCA): Tools like BlackDuck or Snyk (PoC) should scan any plugin dependencies.
	•	Implement sandboxing for plugins: Use secure containers (Firecracker, gVisor) for any plugin execution tied to LLM orchestration layers.
	•	Create a plugin approval framework: Implement a governance process (based on CIS Controls or CSA LLM Guidance) to vet plugin security and required scopes.

⸻

LLM08: Excessive Agency – Not Covered

Current Tools: None
Gap: No safeguards on LLMs executing actions beyond defined roles

Recommendations:
	•	Define operational policy boundaries for LLMs using role-based inference permissions (e.g., via AWS Lambda permissions or Azure AI role-based access).
	•	Enforce human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints on all LLM-initiated actions like email sending, database writes, or access changes.
	•	Tag and limit LLM-accessible APIs using tools like Apigee to restrict LLM to only essential workflows.

⸻

LLM09: Overreliance – Partially Covered

Current Tools: Security Awareness Training (Cornerstone LMS), Manual Review
Gap: User blind trust in model output; absence of audit trail

Recommendations:
	•	Educate business units on LLM hallucinations and risk implications via LMS modules and mandatory refreshers.
	•	Mandate human validation in workflows that use model outputs for decisions (e.g., legal, financial).
	•	Track LLM output usage in audit logs to detect improper reliance.

⸻

LLM10: Model Theft – Not Covered

Current Tools: None
Gap: No monitoring of API abuse, model inference scraping, or credential leakage

Recommendations:
	•	Enable API metering and throttling via tools like Apigee, WAF, or custom access tokens with expiration.
	•	Deploy model watermarking tools (e.g., Mithril, Glaze for vision models).
	•	Monitor exfil patterns via CrowdStrike, GuardDuty, and Splunk for large outbound data or anomalous model access.

Let me know if you’d like this turned into a formal Confluence page format or summarized for a CISO-level briefing.


As of May 2025, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has not released a new version of the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) since version 4.0.12. However, in June 2024, CSA published the CCM Implementation Guidelines v2.0, which provide enhanced guidance on implementing CCM v4.0 controls in alignment with the Shared Security Responsibility Model (SSRM) . ￼

Key Enhancements in CCM Implementation Guidelines v2.0:
	•	Clarification of Responsibilities: The guidelines delineate the security responsibilities between Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Cloud Service Customers (CSCs), facilitating clearer accountability. ￼
	•	Best Practices for Control Implementation: They offer detailed best practices for implementing CCM v4.0 control specifications, aiding organizations in strengthening their cloud security posture. ￼
	•	Assessment and Compliance Support: The guidelines assist organizations in conducting implementation assessments of their CSPs and in responding to the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ). ￼

Implications for Your Organization:

Given your existing toolset and security architecture, the following actions are recommended:
	•	Review and Integrate Guidelines: Examine the CCM Implementation Guidelines v2.0 to ensure your current controls align with the clarified responsibilities and best practices. ￼
	•	Update Security Policies: Incorporate the delineated responsibilities into your organizational security policies and contracts with CSPs to enhance compliance and accountability. ￼
	•	Leverage Assessment Tools: Utilize the CAIQ and other assessment tools provided by CSA to evaluate your CSPs’ adherence to the CCM controls and to identify areas for improvement. ￼

If you require a detailed mapping of these guidelines to your specific tools and processes, or assistance in updating your security policies accordingly, please let me know, and I can provide further support.


Here is the mapping of the CSA CCM Implementation Guidelines v2.0 (June 2024) enhancements to your existing tools and processes in GitHub Markdown format:

Would you like tailored recommendations or gap-remediation steps for the partially covered items above? ￼


Here are tailored recommendations to strengthen coverage of the partially covered enhancements from the CSA CCM Implementation Guidelines v2.0:

⸻

1. Clarified SSRM Responsibilities

Gap: CSP/CSC delineation may not be formally documented across control families.

Recommendations:
	•	Establish a Central SSRM Register: Create a living matrix (e.g., Confluence or GRC tool) mapping each CCM control to CSP/CSC/Shared.
	•	Embed SSRM in Contracts: Ensure roles/responsibilities are reflected in MSAs, DPAs, and cloud onboarding templates.
	•	Automate Gap Analysis: Use CSA’s SSRM Template and map responsibilities to implemented tools and policies.

⸻

2. SSRM Mapped to Each Control

Gap: Lack of traceable linkage between each CCM control and responsibility owner.

Recommendations:
	•	Integrate CCM v4.0 into GRC Tool (e.g., Archer, ServiceNow): Add a column for SSRM mapping per control.
	•	Link with Existing SOPs: Tie operational procedures (e.g., IAM provisioning, incident response) to the party (CSP vs CSC) accountable for control execution.
	•	Create dashboards to monitor the ownership model and flag controls without a clear SSRM designation.

⸻

3. Updated CAIQ Alignment

Gap: No structured method for preparing CAIQ answers or cross-referencing evidence.

Recommendations:
	•	Use CSA CAIQ Excel Templates: Integrate with your audit prep folder or GRC tooling.
	•	Develop an Artifact Evidence Library: Use SharePoint or a Confluence page with URLs/docs tagged to CAIQ sections.
	•	Assign CAIQ Ownership: For each CAIQ domain (IAM, audit, BCDR), assign a control steward responsible for evidence updates before audits.

⸻

4. Implementation Assessment Template

Gap: No structured internal self-assessment mechanism for control effectiveness.

Recommendations:
	•	Download CSA’s Assessment Template and align it with internal control attestations.
	•	Automate periodic control reviews: Add quarterly checklists in your GRC platform to test effectiveness per domain (e.g., IAM token rotation tested, DLP suppression logs reviewed).
	•	Report Control Effectiveness via Dashboards: Use Splunk/Prisma Cloud to build visual reports for audit control coverage by domain (green/yellow/red).
